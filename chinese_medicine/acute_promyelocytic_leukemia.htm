The risk of <a href="Thrombosis.htm" style="text-decoration: none">thrombosis</a> and bleeding is mainly due to the decline of the total platelets. The risk of 
<a style="text-decoration: none" href=http://hematology.org/education/>fungal infection</a>, especially infection of Aspergillus nigers, is due 
to the lowering of the total functional white cells caused by the disease, chemotherapy and the use of steroids to counter the side effect of ATRA therapy and at the same time of intravenous feeding, which is necessary for medication and for the infusion of platelets (when the total platelet count is dangerously low).</font></p><p style="margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 4.5pt; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0pt"><a name=The>

In the editor's opinion, when the condition has been stabilized, Chinese herbs to promote platelets and white cells can be used. Use of Chinese herb formulae for fungal infection should also be investigated.</font></p><p style="margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 4.5pt; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
    <font size="4">Many medical professionals cannot see the risk of 
<a style="text-decoration: none" href=http://hematology.org/education/>thrombosis</a> because of the high <a style="text-decoration: none" href="prothrombin_time.htm">prothrombin time</a> of the APL patients.&nbsp; Actually these are different issues. The hypercoagulopathy (pervasive blood clot) is caused by the thromboplastin - like substance secreted by the abnormal <a href="acute_promyelocytic_leukemia.htm#Auer%20Rod" style="text-decoration: none">Auer rods</a> of the bone marrow cells. According 
to one statistical source, 60 % of the patients died of bleeding in the brain before receiving treatment. The hypercoagulopathy in the blood vessels causes the drop of the total platelets, thus causing the bleeding. The editor first learned of 
the risk of hypercoagulopathy through a stressful way. The editor was visiting his son in Stanford hospital near midnight and found that his pulse reading (traditional Chinese pulse reading) indicated an eminent pending massive blood clot. Using qi on certain acupoints relieved his symptoms temporarily. The editor raised the issue with a medical student who was on duty, and she was not convinced because of the high prothrombin time shown on the blood test reports. While discussing the issue, a nurse arrived with the <a href="heparin_sodium.htm" style="text-decoration: none">heparin</a> medication ordered previously by the patient's main doctor .</font></p><p style="margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 4.5pt; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
    <font size="4">Another problem is that antifungal drugs are highly toxic.

    <font size="4">The use of All-trans Retinoic Acid for promoting the forming of bone marrow cells was first published by Prof. Zhen Yi Wang (<span style="font-family: &#27161;&#26999;&#39636;; ">&#29579;&#27491;&#20736;) of Shanghai Medical School d</span>uring the later part of the 80's.&nbsp; This brought the ATRA out of the research stage from the laboratories into clinical use.</font></p><p style="margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 4.5pt; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">
    <font size="4">This therapy modality is definitely different from the traditional Western approach where the therapy has been focusing on eradicating the cancer cells. Although ATRA cannot eliminate the cancer genes and cannot completely cure the patients of APL,&nbsp; it can lower 85% of the hyper coagulation 
to achieve the remission rate of 80% to 90% and lower the mortality rate of 85% 
to less than 10%. Using conventional chemotherapy, the resulting sepsis caused by the lowering of 
the white cells count, can happen.&nbsp; Compared to using chemotherapy or the high difficulty of bone marrow transplant, this ATRA therapy is better in many ways. 
The quality of life of patients is better and without the side effects of chemotherapy. But, the shortcoming of ATRA therapy is the risk of overproduction of white cells and the rapid development of drug resistance. Thus chemotherapy is still being used in conjunction with ATRA therapy.</font></font></p><b><p style="margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 4.5pt; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 4.5pt; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">

    <font size="4">The use of arsenic trioxide has a long history. Some classical formulae are found in writings dated to the Han dynasty (more than two thousand years). The use of arsenic in modern clinical application is much earlier than the use of ATRA.&nbsp; As early as 1972, in mainland China, arsenic trioxide was being used in myelocytic leukemia. The result was reported in Chinese journals <sup>[1]</sup> that 22 patients out of 81 were completely in remission, 7 of M<sub>2</sub> and 15 of M<sub>3</sub>. The substance used was extract of arsenic:
    </font> </span><font size="4">As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>1mg/ml and HgCl 0.01mg/ml. The result was that the Aur rods of promyelocyte gradually disappeared or shrank. Later it was found that it was especially effective for APL. Subsequently the results were published in various Chinese journals.
    </font> <span lang=en-us><font size="4"><sup>[2,3]</sup>&nbsp; 
The common discovery was that the remission rates were 60 ~ 70%, regardless of 
whether they were first time patients or refractory patients, or recurring after ATRA or chemotherapy. Later it was discovered that excluding HgCl 
or just taking arsenic sulfide could achieve the same result. During the 90's 
the understanding of the apoptosis of cells, the transformation of bone marrow 
cells and peripheral blood led to the understanding of the function of arsenic trioxide that causes the apoptosis of cells leading to the cure of APL. The side effects include nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, diarrhea, numbness in the extremities of limbs, edema in the lower limbs, settlement of skin pigments, abnormal function of the liver. But, because of the low dosage, cirrhosis of the liver or organ exhaustion has never occurred.&nbsp; Later, in vitro experiments also proved that arsenic trioxide also can cause apoptosis of cells, especially promyelocytes.</font></span></p><p style="margin-left: 9pt; margin-right: 4.5pt; margin-top: 5pt; margin-bottom: 0pt"><span lang=en-us>
