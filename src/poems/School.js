        Wake up <br/>
        Go to school <br/>
        Indulge in the meaningless conversations <br/>
        Created by social necessity <br/>
        <br/>
        Wake up <br/>
        Go to school <br/>
        Compete unknowingly <br/>
        To be the best dressed <br/>
        Most attractive <br/>
        Most popular <br/>
        <br/>
        Wake up <br/>
        Go to school <br/>
        Feel the frustration as it weighs you down <br/>
        Trying to digest <br/>
        The 1 + 1s <br/>
        The verbs of Spanish <br/>
        The reasons for imperialism...<br/>
        Oh wait this is science <br/>
        <br/>
        Wake up <br/>
        Go to school <br/>
        Feel the stress of a thousand <br/>
        Tests <br/>
        Homework assignments <br/>
        Projects  <br/>
        Essays <br/>
         Sweeping across the air <br/>
        Stealing your breath <br/>
        <br/>
        Wake up <br/>
        Go To School <br/>
        Look around and see a sea of: <br/>
        Supreme, <br/>
        Adidas,<br/>
        Vans,<br/>
        Obey, <br/>
        Hurley,<br/>
        No longer noticed as people <br/>
        ….<br/>
        But as brands <br/>
        <br/>
        Wake up <br/>
        Go to school <br/>
        Realizes the depressing monotony of a thousand teens <br/>
        We are machines  <br/>
        Preparing to become consumers of a world where creativity no longer exists <br/>
        Just wake up and go to school <br/>
        </div>
      )
    }
