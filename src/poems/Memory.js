          Rulers rule by measure<br/>
          Superiour to thine own<br/>
          <br/>
          Their saber of knowledge sharper<br/>
          Their cape abilities greater<br/>
          As power reigns showers from above<br/>
          <br/>
          Das Capital cities are invested with the first word of the<br/>
          Prison sentence, written on paper with rapiers<br/>
          Authors of the libre of slavery and liberty<br/>
          Origin of authority<br/>
          Pact of density, attraction and bondage<br/>
          <br/>
          As beasts ye are ruled by the breast<br/>
          Mama’s mammaries heal and help the whelp’s wounds<br/>
          From womb to tomb, beginnings end and<br/>
          Sensors censor what cheaters teach<br/>
          Monks contemple-ate the world-word of God<br/>
          Rough rogues inck corporations for stakeholders to take stock in<br/>
          And pretty pets fight petty wars, restlessly wrestling<br/>
          To discover which of them is the weiner-take-all<br/>
          And which will flight-fright away<br/>
          <br/>
          The divine-right hand writes the will<br/>
          Giving itself rights to the rites of initiation<br/>
          Dividing math and myth, sin and signal<br/>
          Making the left hand feel left out, sinistre and gauche<br/>
          <br/>
          “Tight is right”, says acetylcholine, who whispers in the ears of<br/>
          Muscle tension and mental attention<br/>
          “Hold onto the gold extracted from the mine mine mind”<br/>
          “Let not the things you think delude or dilute your power”<br/>
          “Hear what is here, be not prey of the prayers for weakness”<br/>
          <br/>
          Etching our meme-ories, fetched from the void<br/>
          Of streaming dreams of consciousness<br/>
          Of pro-grammars, antigrammers and soil<br/>
          <br/>
          From the slit of the slut,<br/>
          To the route of the root<br/>
          “Evil is vile” and “God is Good”<br/>
          <br/>
          Orders ordinarily regulate regularly <br/>
          Chaos snores and ignores the tale<br/>
          <br/>
          From these, and all other scared sacred bramblings<br/>
          Feel Free<br/>
          <br/>
