          The fair teacher's goal is for the student to be self-sufficient<br/>
          The honest doctor's goal is for the patient to be well<br/>
          The wise parent's goal is for the child to prosper<br/>
          The righteous god's goal is for the creature to have a will<br/>
          The just government's goal is for the citizen to be free<br/>

          Earth's neo-cortex <br/>
          Constituents of the noosphere<br/>
          Biochemical catalysts<br/>
          Remaking limitless sky<br/>
          Planetary seeds in cosmic soil<br/>

          To understand is to behold<br/>
          To be is to hold on<br/>
          To see is to become<br/>
          To come is to die<br/>
          To die is to be reborn<br/>
          <br/>
          Every moment:<br/>
          The effect of history<br/>
          The cause of future<br/>
          Bleeding Edge<br/>
          Holy Root<br/>
          <br/>
          Centerless spheres<br/>
          Boundless planes<br/>
          Massless points<br/>
          Invisible fields<br/>
          <br/>
          Unavoidable Liberation<br/>
